# [**Project 1: Demographic Data Analyzer**](https://github.com/sarthaka2018/Demographic-Data-Analyzer)
A challenge by FCC where we need to analyze demographic data using Pandas. We are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

Used Pandas to answer the following questions:

* How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
* What is the average age of men?
* What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
* What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
* What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
* What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
* What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
* What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
* Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.


# [**Project 2: Medical Data Visualisation**](https://github.com/sarthaka2018/Medical-Data-Visualizer)
This project involves visualizing and making calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations (provided by FCC).

Used the data to complete the following tasks:

* Adding an overweight column by determining if a person is overweight using BMI. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight.
* Normalizing the data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad across all the columns.
* Cleaning the data and Filtering out the patient segments that represent incorrect data like
  * diastolic pressure is higher than systolic
  * height is less than the 2.5th percentile
  * height is more than the 97.5th percentile
  * weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
  * weight is more than the 97.5th percentile
* Creating a correlation matrix using seaborn's heatmap()

# [**Project 3: Page View Analysis**](https://github.com/sarthaka2018/Page-View-Visualisation)

This project involves visualizing time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. With the use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn we visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will to you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
